# Docker containers' volumes locations (dirs will be created if don't exist).
# Except for Plex, all the other volumes are very lightweight.
# Storing them inside an external disk might be a good idea if you plan to run this on multiple machines using the same media library.

# Torrent client downloads directory. It will hold incomplete and completed downloads.
# If you're using an external HDD to store your media files, 
#   it might be a good idea to keep downloads (until moved by Sonarr/Radarr, and if you have enough space) in an SSD disk partition.
#   This aims to avoid constant write ops on the external HDD.
